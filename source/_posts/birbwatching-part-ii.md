My latest book [Birbwatching](https://squareup.com/store/mad-macaques-press/item/birbwatching) is now officially available on my [online store](https://squareup.com/store/mad-macaques-press/item/birbwatching)! It is a collection of birbs observed by an amateur, but can be enjoyed by experts and newbies alike.

I also colored and printed [eight more birb prints which are now available on the online store](http://store.madmacaques.com/item/birb-prints). See the newest prints here below.
