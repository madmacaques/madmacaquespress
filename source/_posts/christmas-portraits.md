This year, I decided to draw a 5x7-in portrait for each person in my family as a gift. It was an exciting challenge to draw characters/people I've never attempted before. Everything was drawn digitally on my Surface Pro 4 and then printed on speckletone cardstock. I'm pretty happy with how they turned out, and I'm thinking about selling them as prints when I do my next show. Apologies to all the masters from whom I've tried to ape.
