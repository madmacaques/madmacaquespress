I wrote this short comic for my friend [Kat Efird](https://twitter.com/katefird) to draw in 2017, based on a tabletop game we were playing back in day called [Servants of the Cinder Queen](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/137011/Servants-of-the-Cinder-Queen) with our group ([Denis St. John](http://www.deniscomix.com/), [Alena Carnes](https://twitter.com/alenacarnes), [Chris Joel](https://twitter.com/0xcda7a)). We made it for an RPG anthology about teamwork and making the dream work. It's still one of my favorite comics of all time.
