This week, we learned about the animation basics you can do with Maya. It's quite comprehensive, and you can get very technical with it if you use scripting language. But for this week, I only tried doing basic camera animation, dollying and tracking a scene attached to a motion path.

Here's one simple animation I did with the actual model that felt pretty cool.

There's only two more classes left before the semester is over so the next few weeks will be dedicated to improving the model to look as real as I can make it.
