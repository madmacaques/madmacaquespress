A few months ago, I did a couple of illustrations for my brother-in-law, [Lucas Joel's](https://www.lvjwriting.com/) short story, "The Luminaries". It's a wonderful depiction of the annual luminaries parade in Michigan, with a Neil Gaiman-eqsue twist!

I really liked the way these turned out, and I'm looking forward to more of these to come.
