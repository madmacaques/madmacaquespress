I designed these characters for a game Chris made for work called [Polymon](https://polymon.polymer-project.org/), where you can collect little creatures and battle against your friends/enemies. Given my predisposition toward delicious tasting food, I based the creatures on some of my favorite things to eat. Here's a screenshot of the little Polymons on the bottom of the screen waiting to still be collected (in silhouette) or selected for battle.
